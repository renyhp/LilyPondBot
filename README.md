# LilyPondBot
A Telegram bot to compile LilyPond code.

Created with Monodevelop on Xubuntu, run on Ubuntu. Should also work on Visual Studio / Windows, provided that you change the LilyPond path in the `LilyPondProcess` method in `LilyPondBot/LilyPond.cs`.

Before you build the solution, check the `Settings` in `LilyPondBot/Helpers.cs`. You may want to change the path of the token or the dev's TelegramID.
